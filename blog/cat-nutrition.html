                <h2>Understanding Feline Nutritional Requirements</h2>
                <p>Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of animal-based proteins to thrive. Unlike omnivores, cats have specific nutritional needs that must be met through their diet. Understanding these requirements is crucial for maintaining your cat's health and well-being throughout their life.</p>
                
                <h3>Essential Nutrients for Cats</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Cats require high levels of animal-based protein (minimum 26% for adults, 30% for kittens)</li>
                    <li><strong>Taurine:</strong> An essential amino acid found only in animal tissues</li>
                    <li><strong>Arachidonic Acid:</strong> A fatty acid necessary for skin and coat health</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Must be obtained from animal sources as cats cannot convert beta-carotene</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Critical for kidney function and overall hydration</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <p>Understanding the different types of cat food available and their benefits is essential for making informed decisions about your cat's diet.</p>

                <h3>Dry Food (Kibble)</h3>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>

                    <li>Minimal processing</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires careful handling to prevent bacterial contamination</li>
                    <li>Must be properly balanced to meet nutritional needs</li>
                    <li>Time-consuming to prepare</li>
                </ul>
