                <h2 id="basics">Cat Nutrition Basics</h2>
                <p>Understanding what to feed your cat starts with knowing their nutritional requirements. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need meat to survive. Here's what your cat's diet should include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protein (30-40%): Essential for muscle maintenance and energy</li>
                    <li>Fat (15-20%): Provides energy and helps absorb vitamins</li>
                    <li>Carbohydrates (5-10%): Should be limited in cat diets</li>
                    <li>Essential amino acids (especially taurine)</li>
                    <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
                    <li>Water (70-80% of body weight)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Cat Food</h2>
                <div class="faq-section">
                    <h3>What is the best food to feed your cat?</h3>
                    <p>The best cat food should be high in protein (30-40%), moderate in fat (15-20%), and low in carbohydrates. Look for foods with real meat as the first ingredient and avoid artificial additives. Wet food is generally better than dry food for hydration and protein content.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How much should I feed my cat?</h3>
                    <p>Adult cats typically need 20-30 calories per pound of body weight daily. For a 10-pound cat, this means 200-300 calories. Split this into 2-3 meals. Always follow the feeding guidelines on your cat's food package and adjust based on your cat's age, activity level, and health.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What human food can cats eat?</h3>
                    <p>Cats can safely eat small amounts of cooked chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, and some vegetables like carrots and green beans. However, avoid toxic foods like onions, garlic, chocolate, grapes, and dairy products. Always consult your vet before introducing human food.</p>

                    <h3>Is wet food better than dry food for cats?</h3>
                    <p>Wet food is generally better for cats because it provides more moisture and protein, which is closer to their natural diet. However, a combination of both wet and dry food is often ideal - wet food for hydration and protein, dry food for dental health and convenience.</p>

                    <h3>How often should I feed my cat?</h3>
                    <p>Kittens should be fed 3-4 times daily, adult cats 2-3 times daily, and senior cats 2 times daily. Free-feeding is not recommended for most cats as it can lead to obesity. Stick to regular meal times for better weight management.</p>

                    <h3>What ingredients should I avoid in cat food?</h3>
                    <p>Avoid artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, as well as meat by-products and excessive fillers like corn and wheat. Look for foods with named meat sources (e.g., "chicken" instead of "poultry") as the first ingredient.</p>

                    <h3>How do I transition my cat to a new food?</h3>
                    <p>Mix the new food with the old food gradually over 7-10 days, increasing the proportion of new food each day. This helps prevent digestive upset and allows your cat to adjust to the new taste and texture.</p>

                    <h3>What's the difference between kitten and adult cat food?</h3>
                    <p>Kitten food has higher protein and fat content, more calories, and additional nutrients like DHA for brain development. It's formulated to support rapid growth and development. Adult cat food has balanced nutrition for maintenance.</p>

                    <h3>Should I feed my cat grain-free food?</h3>
                    <p>While grain-free diets can be beneficial for some cats with allergies, they're not necessary for all cats. The key is to ensure the food is high in protein and low in carbohydrates, regardless of whether it contains grains.</p>

                    <h3>How do I know if my cat is allergic to their food?</h3>
                    <p>Signs of food allergies include itchy skin, excessive grooming, hair loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and ear infections. If you suspect a food allergy, consult your vet for testing and consider switching to a limited ingredient diet.</p>

                    <h3>What's the best way to store cat food?</h3>
                    <p>Dry food should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Wet food should be refrigerated after opening and used within 2-3 days. Always check expiration dates and store food away from direct sunlight.</p>

                    <h3>How much water should my cat drink?</h3>
                    <p>Cats should drink about 3.5-4.5 ounces of water per 5 pounds of body weight daily. Cats eating wet food may drink less water, while those on dry food need more. Always provide fresh, clean water.</p>

                    <h3>What's the difference between premium and budget cat food?</h3>
                    <p>Premium foods typically have higher quality ingredients, more protein, fewer fillers, and better quality control. Budget foods may contain more fillers and lower quality protein sources. However, some mid-range brands offer good value for quality.</p>

                    <h3>Should I feed my cat organic food?</h3>
                    <p>Organic cat food can be beneficial but isn't necessary for all cats. The most important factors are high protein content, quality ingredients, and proper nutrition. If you choose organic, ensure it meets all nutritional requirements.</p>

                    <h3>How do I know if my cat is getting enough nutrients?</h3>
                    <p>Signs of good nutrition include a shiny coat, healthy skin, good energy levels, proper weight, and regular bowel movements. Regular vet check-ups can help ensure your cat's nutritional needs are being met.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Cat Food Labels</h2>
                <p>Reading cat food labels can be confusing. Here's what to look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Named Protein Source:</strong> Look for specific meats like "chicken" or "salmon" rather than generic terms like "poultry" or "fish"</li>
                    <li><strong>Guaranteed Analysis:</strong> Shows minimum protein and fat content, maximum fiber and moisture</li>
                    <li><strong>AAFCO Statement:</strong> Indicates the food meets nutritional standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Life Stage:</strong> Should match your cat's age (kitten, adult, senior)</li>
                    <li><strong>Ingredients List:</strong> Ingredients are listed by weight, with the heaviest first</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Cat Food Myths</h2>
                <div class="myth-busting">
                    <h3>Myth: Cats need milk</h3>
                    <p>Most adult cats are lactose intolerant and shouldn't drink milk. While kittens need their mother's milk, adult cats should drink water instead.</p>

                    <h3>Myth: Dry food cleans teeth</h3>
                    <p>While some dry foods may help reduce tartar, they don't replace proper dental care. Regular brushing and dental check-ups are still necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Myth: Cats should only eat meat</h3>
                    <p>While cats are obligate carnivores, they can digest small amounts of carbohydrates. The key is ensuring meat is the primary ingredient.</p>

                    <h3>Myth: Expensive food is always better</h3>
                    <p>Price isn't always an indicator of quality. Look at ingredients and nutritional content rather than price alone.</p>
